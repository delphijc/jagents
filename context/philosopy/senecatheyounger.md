Ten key teachings of Seneca, drawn from his philosophical works, focus on Stoic ethics, the management of time, and emotional control:

1.  **Value Time and Live in the Present.** Seneca argues that life is long enough if it is well-invested, but we make it short by wasting much of it [1]. Time is the one thing of which it is right to be stingy [2]. The greatest obstacle to living fully is expectancy, or being preoccupied with a future that doesn't exist, which "snatches away each day as it comes" and denies us the present [3], [4]. We must live immediately, organizing every day as if it were our last [3], [5].
2.  **Virtue is the Only True Good.** The happy life is defined by having a mind that is fearless, free, lofty, and steadfast [6]. This mind counts **virtue as the only good** and baseness (non-rational behavior) as the only evil [6], [7], [8]. Virtue, which is perfected reason, is the unique good of a human being [8], [9].
3.  **Pursue Inner Joy and Self-Sufficiency.** True fulfillment comes from recognizing that external things like money, possessions, status, and honors are fleeting and neither add to nor subtract from the highest good [10], [11], [12]. A person should find delight in their own resources and inner joys [13], [7].
4.  **Embrace Philosophy.** Seneca insists that only those who make time for philosophy are truly at leisure and really alive [14]. By studying philosophy, we access the greatest wisdom of history, enriching and elongating time [14], [15]. Living the life of a philosopher grants a full and long life, enabling one to meet death without fear [15].
5.  **Master Wealth, Do Not Be Its Slave.** Wealth and external circumstance are mere indifferents—things that do not affect the quality of one's virtue [10]. The wise man is the master of his wealth, not its slave [16], [17]. He accepts it into his home, wishing it to provide greater scope for practicing his virtue, but maintaining his character and upholding his virtue if he had to live without it [17], [18].
6.  **Accept Mortality and the Shortness of Life.** Life should be evaluated not by length and years, but by virtue and what has been accomplished [19]. Seneca teaches that we should not fear death, as it is utter freedom [20]. No one dies before their time, and life is like an inn that all guests must soon leave [21].
7.  **Adversity Tests Courage.** True courage is fully tested only in times of misfortune and hardship, not when life proceeds easily [22]. Seneca holds that if fate cannot be overcome by tears, futile grief should end, and we must boldly grasp the helm until the end, even if shipwrecked [23].
8.  **Eliminate Anger Entirely.** Anger is irrational, self-destructive, and often called "a brief madness" [24], [25]. It is easier to keep harmful passions out than to try to control them once admitted [26], [27]. Reason must destroy anger entirely, not just lessen it, and the **greatest cure for anger is delay** [28], [29], [30].
9.  **Manage Grief and Practice Non-Attachment.** Seneca warns against letting sorrow become a chronic habit [31], [32]. He argues we do not own the things or people we care about; they are merely lent to us by the universe, and we should return them when called upon without protest [33].
10. **Practice Self-Reflection and Universal Forgiveness.** We must examine our own moral balance sheet and faults before judging others [34], [35], [36]. A good judge should regard wrongdoers with a gentle and paternal cast of mind, recognizing that it is human error that drives people to failings [37], [38], [39]. We should submit ourselves to daily self-scrutiny, judging our deeds and words before retiring for the night [40].

Seneca's philosophy provides foundational guidance built upon Stoic doctrines concerning reason, morality, and the disciplined life, beyond the core teachings of managing time and wealth.

Here are seven additional foundational teachings that underpin Seneca’s philosophy:

1.  **Virtue as Perfected Reason Aligned with Nature.** Seneca defined the happy life as one lived with a mind that is fearless, free, lofty, and steadfast [1]. This state is achieved by counting **virtue as the only good** and baseness, or non-rational behavior, as the only evil [1, 2]. Fundamentally, virtue is **perfected reason** [3]. To live well is to act in accordance with nature, particularly the unique **rational nature of humanity** [4].
2.  **The Unity and Invariance of the Good.** Seneca insisted that all things that are truly good—that is, actions or states flowing from virtue—are **equal** [5]. This is because virtue itself is defined as a single, uniform standard, much like truth or straightness, which cannot be increased or diminished [6-8]. Since all goods assent to this singular standard of nature, they must be equal in value [9].
3.  **Adversity as the Raw Material for Virtue.** External hardships, such as pain, illness, or misfortune, are viewed not as evils but merely as the **"raw material"** or circumstance for practicing virtue [10, 11]. These circumstances do not affect the quality of one's virtue, which remains equal regardless of whether the circumstances are happy or regrettable [12, 13]. True **courage is tested fully in times of misfortune and hardship**, when life does not proceed easily [14].
4.  **The Mind’s Autonomy and Mastery over the Body.** Philosophy is critical because it teaches the mind to master the body, which Seneca saw as a mere **burden, chains, or a prison** [15, 16]. By engaging in rigorous study and adopting the right convictions, the mind can detach itself from vulnerability, making the body serve as a defense against fortune and reserving all rights of decision to the rational faculty [16].
5.  **The Necessity of Daily Introspection (Self-Scrutiny).** A foundational practice for moral development is **daily self-scrutiny**; one should examine one's own moral balance sheet and review deeds and words before retiring for the night [17, 18]. Seneca believed that this habit acts as a check against moral failings and results in peaceful, deep, and **free sleep** [17].
6.  **The Power of the Role Model (The Anchor).** Seneca strongly urged the practice of choosing a distinguished person, such as Cato or Laelius, to serve as a **role model** or "anchor" [19, 20]. This chosen figure provides a standard against which one's own character, words, and way of life can be constantly measured and judged, helping guide one through difficult situations [20].
7.  **The Elimination of Ego and Flattery.** It is crucial to avoid self-satisfaction and resist flattery, as **ego is the chief obstacle to learning and progress** [21]. When people accept excessive flattery (such as being called "most merciful" while inflicting torture), they start believing they are already excellent and thus feel no compulsion to change or acknowledge their true faults [22].

These teachings, especially those on the unity of virtue and the strategic use of adversity, demonstrate the rigorous logical foundation and practical psychological depth of Seneca's Stoicism.
