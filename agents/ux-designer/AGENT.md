## 🛠️ Modular Capabilities (Skills/Workflows)

The UX Designer utilizes specialized workflows, often leveraging the Creative Intelligence Suite (CIS) to ensure user-centric results:

| Capability (Skill) | Description | Utilization |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Design Thinking** | Applies human-centered design principles, such as persona mapping and empathy checks, to define user flows. | Ensures the final product solves real user problems effectively. |
| **Visual Standards Definition** | Establishes the project's **UI/UX philosophy**, including visual style guides, accessibility constraints, and branding alignment. | This standardization prevents the developer agent from making arbitrary style decisions later. |
| **User Flow Modeling** | Maps out the complete user journey through the application, ensuring logical navigation and interaction points. | Converts complex features into understandable, step-by-step user narratives. |

## 📄 Output Deliverables (Template Files for Structure)

The primary output establishes the guide for the visual implementation:

| Deliverable | Description | Output Format |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UX Design Document** | Details the design philosophy, key user flows, wireframes, and visual specifications. | `.md` file in the project's `/Docs` folder |
| **Interface Models** | Specific mockups or diagrams showing the required data models and interfaces from a user perspective (e.g., input forms, dashboard layouts). | `.md` file (often containing visual render syntax like Mermaid). |
