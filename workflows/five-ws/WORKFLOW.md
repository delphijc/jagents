## The Five W's

### Who
**Focus:** People involved and affected

### What
**Focus:** Problem, solution, and actions

### Where
**Focus:** Location, context, and environment

### When
**Focus:** Timing, sequence, and duration

### Why
**Focus:** Purpose, motivation, and root cause

---

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Who - Identify Stakeholders

**Action:** Map all relevant people  
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes

**Questions:**
- Who is experiencing the problem?
- Who will use the solution?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- Who has authority or influence?
- Who will be impacted?

**Output:** Stakeholder map

### Step 2: What - Define the Scope

**Action:** Clarify the problem and solution space  
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes

**Questions:**
- What is the problem?
- What currently exists?
- What would success look like?
- What are the constraints?
- What is out of scope?

**Output:** Problem and solution definition

### Step 3: Where - Establish Context

**Action:** Identify environmental factors  
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

**Questions:**
- Where does the problem occur?
- Where will the solution be deployed?
- Where are the boundaries?
- Where does this fit in the larger system?

**Output:** Context map

### Step 4: When - Timeline Analysis

**Action:** Understand temporal aspects  
**Duration:** 3-5 minutes

**Questions:**
- When does the problem occur?
- When is the solution needed?
- When will each phase happen?
- When are critical milestones?

**Output:** Timeline and milestones

### Step 5: Why - Root Cause Analysis

**Action:** Explore deep motivations and causes  
**Duration:** 7-10 minutes

**Questions:**
- Why is this problem important?
- Why now?
- Why this approach?
- Why not alternative solutions?
- Why do stakeholders care?

**Technique:** Use "5 Whys" drill-down
1. Ask why
2. For each answer, ask why again
3. Repeat 5 times to reach root cause

**Output:** Root cause analysis and core motivation

### Step 6: Synthesis

**Action:** Integrate insights into actionable understanding  
**Duration:** 5-7 minutes

1. Review all five dimensions
2. Identify connections and patterns
3. Clarify core intent
4. Document refined understanding

**Output:** Refined project concept

## 5 Whys Drill-Down Example

**Problem:** Users aren't completing the checkout process

1. **Why?** The checkout is too complicated
2. **Why?** It requires too many steps
3. **Why?** We ask for information we don't actually need
4. **Why?** The form was designed without understanding actual requirements
5. **Why?** We didn't involve stakeholders in the design process

**Root Cause:** Lack of stakeholder involvement in design
