1. shoot for lower paying more junior or independent comtributor roles.
2. have a don't give a f attitude.
3. have as many of those as necessary.
4. don't worry about losing job have new ones queued up.

  You had asked about options and how I’m using them. 
  There’s a lot of speculation right now that we might be in some kind of doomsday bubble. 
So, I’m running options as insurance. 
Kinda like the big short stuff
Basically, if the market crashes, I will make 2$ for every 1$ my specific portfolio would drop. 
This means, that if the market drops 20%, while I’d lose that 20%, 
I make 25-30% profit with my safety hedge. 
Which means I’ll actually make money while everyone else losses money. 
This will cost me ~1% of my portfolio value to set up for 1 year. 
I’m holding positions, so if things go up I benefit, but to juice those returns, I’ll also create additional leverage with bullish spreads. So for a similar single digit %, I create an upside position, where I against 1$ for every $ my 150k position goes up. This doubles my upside with only a fraction of upfront investment. So if all my positions go up 20%, I actually earn 40%
I run these side by side, which means I now profit from a crash OR a boom. 
the only way I can lose money, is if the entire market stays flat over the next year, at which point, I lose 2% when both these hedges expire worthless
Then I could run a leveraged Etherium hedge via  ETHW, ETHA, or EETH to similarly hedge against the dollar collapsing. 
But I like to buy Eth direct and put it on my cold storage at my desk, because
I don’t trust financial orgs to actually manage my Eth
Figure out how to dynamically pull slack posts from Dan and then have a request to implement something similar with Acorn, Robinhood, or some similar low dollar investment tool.
Consider where to invest in some Cryptocurrency as discussed above as a hedge against the dollar and other world currencies being deflated and to enable more digital transactions. Look into Cloudflares recent efforts toward that digital economic system.

6. be like dan and buy cool stuff without debt.
